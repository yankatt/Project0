# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Description
In this project I've created a small website about myself, some of my interests and hobbies, a part of my so far career and some photos. It was part of project0 of the course: "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".

### index.html
On the index.html I used bootstrap cards to present the content in a proper manner.

### interests.html
interests.html contains a table, that shows some of my interests. On the top is a navigation-bar to navigate to the other pages. This navbar is used on career.html and photos.html aswell.

### career.html
Like interests.html this page shows a table showing a part of my career so far.

### photos.html
photos.html shows some stock-footage of beautiful spots around the world.
At first I wanted to use my own holiday pictures but i decided to use stock-photos from the internet

### styles.scss
this is a sass file for the look and feel of my website. Out of this I compiled the css-file which is used on my website.
